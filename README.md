Before you run the main code, ensure that MATLAB can find the iFEM functions by adding the package folder (available atâ€¯https://github.com/lyc102/ifem) to your search path. You can do this in either of two ways:

  1. Graphical interface. Click File -> Set Path -> Add with Subfolders and chose the directory where the package iFEM is stored.

  2. Command window. Go to the directory of iFEM and run "setpath"
